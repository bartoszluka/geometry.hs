# `geometry.hs`, a Haskell library for geometry

This is a toy project for learning and playing with Haskell.
The goal is not clearly defined yet but I will implement more shapes like circles and rectangles and a way for them to interact with eachother.

TODO:

- [ ] creating rectangles
- [x] creating circles
- [ ] interactions (e.g. calculating intersections)
