# `geometry.hs`, a Haskell library for geometry

This is a toy project for learning and playing with Haskell.
The goal is not clearly defined yet but I will implement more shapes like circles and rectangles and a way for them to interact with eachother.

TODO:
[ ] creating rectangles
[ ] creating circles
[ ] interactions (e.g. calculating intersections)
